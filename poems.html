          <h2>  Expression</h2>
<p>
Sometimes<br>
Words aren't enough<br>
To express<br>
The feelings<br>
Beyond the stars<br>
The stories<br>
You told me<br>
Would stay<br>
Forever<br>
And ever<br>
In my heart<br>



The horrors<br>
I can't imagine<br>
But the happiness<br>
You shared<br>
Was real<br>
I hope we stay<br>
Like this<br>
For days to come<br>
And decades to go<br>


<br>
At last<br>
Congratulations<br>
For everything you've<br>
Accomplished so far<br>
Why is it so hard<br>
To end this story<br>
When I have so much to say<br>
About your glory!<br>


I can write a novel<br>
On your life<br>
Maybe two<br>
If you told me to write<br>
It's taking time<br>
But its worth<br>
Every second<br>
Every minute<br>
Of my life!</p>

        <h2>Desire</h2>
            <p>

I play with fire<br>
with a desire<br>
following instructions<br>
of my destruction<br>
a path I chose<br>
took me close<br>
to everything I want<br>
and nothing I truly desire<br><br>



Repercussions<br>
Cloud my mind<br>
What else is<br>
There to find<br>
I've achieved<br>
What I wanted<br>
But was it<br>
What I desired?</p>

        <h2>Mistake</h2>
                    <p>
            After you've done everything you wanted to do <br>
            What else is there to be explored and go through<br>
            If you had a choice will there be something 
            You would like to undo <br> 
            <br>
You think back and blink your eyes <br>
You look for things you did wrong and those you did right <br>
 What exactly could you name a mistake?<br>
  What are the things that were at stake?<br>
   You sat on the swing in the night and began to contemplate
    <br>
 <br>
Life is all about ups and downs <br>
Like the swing on which you are trying to frown  <br>
The more you push the higher you go <br>
The zeal to achieve something great <br>
Taking something that's beyond your fate <br>
<br>
You smile at the moon <br>
If only you had known <br>
You could've done something better <br>
To change your future forever 
<br><br>
But would you be here <br>
Thinking without blinking <br>
Sitting on a swing of hope <br>
Why don't I think about the good things? <br>
Why life is all about bling? <br>
The nights get dark <br>
The winds get cold <br>
You remember the day <br>
The hands that you hold <br>
The people that were close <br>
The gems that you lost <br>
<br>
But now you're all alone <br>
What is that sound?<br>
Is it the sound of nature<br>
The sky the earth and every living thing <br>
Are singing a song 
<br>
<br>
What is this? <br>
Are you crying? <br>
Was coming here a mistake<br>
It was a risk you had to take <br>
You smile and this time<br>
It's not fake!<br>
<br>
Pushing the swing <br>
You go up in the sky <br>
You see the light <br>
Everyone you had<br>
Everything you lost <br>
Was in sight <br>
Nothing was even worth the fight<br>
<br>
Only if you had enjoyed <br>
The moments of joy <br>
Instead of sorrow and pain <br>
From things you didn't gain <br>
But you could never refrain <br>
That was the beginning of your bane <br>
<br>
Why no one <br>
Values what they have<br>
And leave what they can't <br>
Dreams are okay to keep <br>
But only if they let you sleep <br>
Don't be tensed <br>
Give yourself some air to breathe<br>
You don't have to stay on your feet <br>
<br>
You won't be where you are <br>
If you did everything right<br>
You may laugh at it now <br>
But you know I am right<br>
This is not the end <br>
It's a new journey <br>
Of finding who you are <br>
And what you want to be
